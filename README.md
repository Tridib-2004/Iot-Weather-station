//Introduction

Weather monitoring plays a vital role in various sectors such as agriculture, disaster management, energy systems, transportation, and the development of smart cities. Accurate and timely weather information helps farmers plan irrigation and harvesting, enables authorities to prepare for natural disasters, and supports efficient energy management. However, traditional weather monitoring stations are expensive to install and maintain, and they provide limited spatial coverage, especially in rural and remote areas. As a result, local communities often depend on generalized weather forecasts that may not accurately represent local environmental conditions.

Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made it possible to develop low-cost, distributed, and intelligent weather monitoring systems. IoT sensors can continuously collect real-time environmental data, while AI and Machine Learning techniques can analyze this data to identify patterns and predict future weather conditions with improved accuracy. This project presents an AI-enabled IoT-based Weather Station designed to provide localized, real-time weather monitoring and prediction. By integrating low-cost sensors, edge computing, and machine learning models, the proposed system aims to improve prediction accuracy, reduce latency, and support data-driven decision-making for agriculture and other weather-dependent applications.
